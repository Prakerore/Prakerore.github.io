<p>Fantasy arena</p>

<p>Fantasy arena is a 3D online multiplayer game where the goal is to defeat the other team through having a higher amount of kills. THe theme here is fantasy, using swords, magic, that kind of stuff. Every unique character has unique abilities that stes them apart form other characters.</p>

<p>So far, I have created AI that can move to and damgage players. The damage component will be used as an integral part of the game.</p>

<p>I have always thought there was something missing that would have made Overwatch more interesting. Despite its massive appeal, the fact that the game was first person made the game a little bland (My game is currently first person. I plan to change that in the near future). Since there was no such game to keep me occupied, I plan on making it myself, whatever it may be.</p>

<p>At this moment, there are no plans to incorporate quests.</p>

<p>Below is the code used to damage the player.</p>
