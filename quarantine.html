<center><h2>(DCSS, my favorite game) Rouguelikes are my favorite because they wait for you and it is an RPG. This is by far my favorite because it does not require memorizing a wiki to win...</h2></center>

<center><h2>I also finally got my Chromebook from requesting it. We only had one computer at home so sharing was tough.</h2></center>
